INTRO
    This is a redesign of the ‘Facilities’ section of the DUS website, which allows users to view a calendar, booking, personal account info, facilities info, course info and more if it is an admin user who has logged in.
PREREQUISITES
    This is a project basing on not only front-end but back-end. Thus, an local php server such as XAMPP or an online server should be installed in advance in order to run the website.
RUNNING
    The index_admin.php is the main page of the project. There will be an amount of information that can be looked into on both laptop and mobile devices. However, only logged-in users have permission to view the booking page, which can be accessed via buttons throughout the pages. The new users can sign up a new account simply after entering serveral lines of personal info and completing an email confirmation procedure. The password can also be reset using the same email address and similar confirmation procedure if the password is lost.
CALENDAR
    Casual members only have the ability to view the calendar with all bookings currently exist and make an additional booking. New bookings can only be made if the chosen period is neither blocked by trainers or administrator nor the number of bookings has surpass the capacity of the facility.
    In addition to previous features, trainers are also allowed to block a facility once every week for a long period for opening new courses. Meanwhile, an admin can not only do all the things above, but is able to delete a current booking and add or remove blocks as wanted.
Management
    Whereas a logged-in user can only manage his/her own account, an admin has the power to manage all info of users, classes and facilities.
